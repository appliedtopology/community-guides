# Example Notebooks for TDA Libraries

We are collecting example notebooks describing how to do common tasks in various libraries. To contribute your own, clone the Example Notebook, and write your own notebook that either does the same things or states clearly that you do not support the corresponding tasks.

Then send in a pull request that places your notebook in its own subdirectory of this directory. We will review it and merge it once it fits our standards.
